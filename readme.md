# My solution to the Glam My Markup challenge

This is a submission for DEV Challenge v24.03.20, [Glam Up My Markup: Camp Activities](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend)

## What I Built

I styled the markup provide and tried to make it a functional form. I used Google's material design principles and the [material theme builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/) to generate a color scheme out of [this image](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1377841262/photo/the-beautiful-scenery-of-a-tent-in-a-pine-tree-forest-at-pang-oung-mae-hong-son-province.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=1JvDx-16zTIeytdcC-Fa27nVJ_8SveP-omNKKlUJ-lQ=) of a camp in a forest. As mentioned in the challenge, I didn't edit the HTML directly but added some boiler plate code such as wrapping it in a body and html, and adding a favicon. The webpage is responsive and has light and dark themes which automatically adapt to the system. At this moment, I didn't add the option to manually change the theme, but I might add it later.

- I copied the markup into a proper html file.
- Gathered fonts, colors and got down a general idea of the project.
- Used CSS with variables to make the project responsive.
- Used JS to provide minimal interaction. Submitting the form shows an alert.
